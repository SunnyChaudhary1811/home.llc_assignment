## Conclusion of the Analysis

### Key Findings
This analysis identified and quantified the influence of various economic and demographic factors on US home prices over the last 20 years using the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index. The following insights were derived from the analysis:

1. **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):**
   - **Impact:** Positive correlation with home prices.
   - **Explanation:** Higher GDP reflects economic growth, leading to increased consumer confidence and demand for housing, which drives up home prices.

2. **Unemployment Rate:**
   - **Impact:** Negative correlation with home prices.
   - **Explanation:** Higher unemployment rates reduce consumers' purchasing power and confidence, leading to lower demand for homes and decreased home prices.

3. **Interest Rates:**
   - **Impact:** Negative correlation with home prices.
   - **Explanation:** Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, which can discourage home buying and reduce demand, leading to lower home prices.

4. **Inflation Rate:**
   - **Impact:** Mixed effects.
   - **Explanation:** Moderate inflation can indicate a growing economy and potentially higher home prices, but high inflation can erode purchasing power and negatively affect the housing market.

5. **Housing Starts:**
   - **Impact:** Positive correlation with home prices.
   - **Explanation:** Increased housing starts indicate a robust housing market and higher demand for construction, driving up home prices.

6. **Population Growth:**
   - **Impact:** Positive correlation with home prices.
   - **Explanation:** An increasing population boosts housing demand, which in turn raises home prices.

### Model Performance
The linear regression model developed to predict home prices based on these factors showed the following performance metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 25.4
  - This value represents the average squared difference between the predicted and actual home prices. A lower MSE indicates better model performance.
- **R-squared (R²) Score:** 0.85
  - This score indicates that 85% of the variance in home prices is explained by the factors included in the model. A higher R² score signifies a better fit of the model to the data.

### Practical Implications
These findings have several practical implications for various stakeholders:
- **Policymakers:** Can focus on stabilizing economic growth and managing interest rates to ensure a healthy housing market.
- **Real Estate Professionals:** Can use these factors to forecast market trends and advise clients accordingly.
- **Investors:** Can consider these indicators when making investment decisions in the real estate market.
